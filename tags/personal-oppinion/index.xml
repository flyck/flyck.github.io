      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, a couple cute Mormon missionaries came over to me and chatted me up. I estimated the three of them to be roughly my age, probably a couple years younger, around 22 to 23. It was a beautiful, sunny Saturday and I incidentally was sitting on a bench near a church. Later they told me they are specifically roaming these areas to do their work. They started out the conversation talking about their strong belief in god, how they talk to him, and how he would answer them their questions. They proceeded asking me what questions I had for god. I didn&#39;t have one and couldn&#39;t even come up with one, but I was interested in chatting with them, so I invited them to sit down with me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Manifesto: noun. A public declaration of policy and aims, especially one issued before an election by a political party or candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinder could get dirty. Tinder could get tedious. I wrote down my original aims when I started using tinder here, before everything falls into chaos later. Much like with other manifestos ;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
