      <description>&lt;p&gt;Early 2019 I joined a local Tai Chi school in Hamburg. After 4 years of weekly practice in an unusual sport, the time has come for a pivot. The time has come for reflections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Indian guru Bhagwan - also later known as Osho - has been one of the most widely known mystics of our time. After his death in January 1990, suddenly his media coverage seems to rise again. An investigation in numbers…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pull Requests kicked around and asked apart, questions flinged at a presenter after the &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo; slide, that judgmental moment of silence after an ill-placed question. Does decency have a place in tech? A question I asked myself 3 years ago, and finally some answers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting by Tai Chi knowledge is not so easy. Most teachers (of the far east) are stingy with their knowledge. But it is a dying martial art, so the knowledge is slowly forgotten. And not everybody has such amount of time to learn. So let me share the best learning resources I know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Considerations about Death</title>

      <guid>https://flyck.github.io/post/considerations_about_death/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Generally the topic of death is largely invisible in our society. Dead people are transported
off of hospitals only during the night, millions are spend on artificial teeth every year and
old people take medication during family gatherings to temporarily overshadow the effect of
&amp;ldquo;old people diseases&amp;rdquo; like Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s. Decay in general pains us and is masked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even though we try to avoid death itself and we generally don&amp;rsquo;t wish it on anybody, which
useful things can we draw from considering death?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been troubling me what constitutes making a contribution to society. Is it going to
work? Is it making art? Is it being a helpful neighbor? Since I&amp;rsquo;m benefiting from a working
society, I sure would want to secure that it keeps thriving, possibly even help elevating it
to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Opposite to the traditional German folk song &amp;ldquo;Die Gedanken sind frei&amp;rdquo; (All thoughts are free)
I claim otherwise. I will explain this in strictly logical terms, giving examples and
scientific evidence, while the insight itself only came after long meditation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our beloved western societies we are very much &lt;span class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;goal oriented&lt;/span&gt;. Things are achieved
mostly by communicating goals and commandments, together with a demand of fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since goal-orientation is everywhere it can be a challenge to even notice that it is
constantly going on, and differentiate &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; advice with advice that is actually helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Identity can be a small thing. I could identify with my home country, my line of work, my
monthly salary or my family name. It could be my hometown, the brand of clothes I wear or a
degree I achieved. Actually, identity &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be a big thing. If that is so, how can the
identity be picked intelligently and how can that choice be undermined by mere attention?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Which differences can we find between survival and living in today&amp;rsquo;s world? Which of the two
holds that sweet sweet satisfaction we&amp;rsquo;re longing for? The meaning we attach to &amp;ldquo;survival&amp;rdquo;
needs to be refreshed, as in today&amp;rsquo;s world we have everything we need, while life can seem
dull and repetitive at times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adults in many ways do have &lt;strong&gt;superpowers&lt;/strong&gt; in the eyes of a child. They have authority. They are
allowed to do many of the things a child cannot do: eat candy whenever they want, stay up
late, drive cars, and schedule their days at their own leisure. Despite these superpowers,
they didn&amp;rsquo;t seem &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; to me as a child. Observing adults faszinated and irritated me, as I&amp;rsquo;m
recalling in this blogpost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I gobbled down two chicken-halves and some mashed potatoes. That was a lot. The other time I was still hungry after a single half, and this time around I was stressing out over barely finishing the meal. I needed to sit down for a bit. I picked a sunny spot. Me being me I took some time to meditate and suddenly I had an epiphany: &amp;ldquo;We are afraid of ourselves, and that is what life is.&amp;quot;. Believe me, this was not the chicken talk, but I had finally figured something out. Let me elaborate…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, a couple cute Mormon missionaries came over to me and chatted me up. I estimated the three of them to be roughly my age, probably a couple years younger, around 22 to 23. It was a beautiful, sunny Saturday and I incidentally was sitting on a bench near a church. Later they told me they are specifically roaming these areas to do their work. They started out the conversation talking about their strong belief in god, how they talk to him, and how he would answer them their questions. They proceeded asking me what questions I had for god. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have one and couldn&amp;rsquo;t even come up with one, but I was interested in chatting with them, so I invited them to sit down with me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Manifesto: noun. A public declaration of policy and aims, especially one issued before an election by a political party or candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinder could get dirty. Tinder could get tedious. I wrote down my original aims when I started using tinder here, before everything falls into chaos later. Much like with other manifestos ;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is pretty important for each of us to be the person we want to be. &lt;em&gt;For survival, for&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;society, for integrity. But what do we know then about who we want to be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The three most important skills to have as a young adult</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The skill to change your habits&lt;/strong&gt;, so you could start trying new ones (better or worse than your current ones) to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The skill to build the desire of trying things truly out of your comfort zone&lt;/strong&gt;, so you could expand your horizon and thereby change more of your habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The skill of writing&lt;/strong&gt;, so you could articulate what it is that you want. Also writing can be a great tool for changing your habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Monitoring &amp; Ansible, Part I: NRPE daemon setup</title>
      <link>https://flyck.github.io/post/monitoring-setup-xinetd-nrpe-ansible/</link>

      <description>Monitoring servers using icinga usually requires a small setup on the monitored server. From the different choices of agents, the nrpe daemon ontop of xinetd is easy enough to set up, while it can provide any kind of information that is available on the monitored server locally. To automate this setup task and as a learning exercise I wrote up an Ansible playbook, which I describe here.
The linux world is big, so you might come here asking: &amp;ldquo;Why the hell do you use xinetd and nrpe for monitoring?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wie stehst du im Leben? Ein einfaches Beobachten der Körperhaltung kann einem schon buchstäblich zeigen wie man im Leben steht. Es ist eine Art Haltungs-Check. Jeder liest Körperhaltung - zumindest unbewusst, meine Beobachtung dazu teile ich hier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I wrote an icinga cluster check which can currently check whether a service runs on atleast on one of two servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A teaser of the results:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I wrote a procmail filter which filters mail for a ticketing system (request-tracker). It filters mails which addresses the ticketing system in Cc as well as mails with attachments bigger than 10 MB. I went through quite a learning curve while writing this filter so I&amp;rsquo;d like to share it here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
