<p>When they asked the #yogi what he was doing, he answered: everything.
#spirituality #meditation</p>
<hr>
<p>Life is a gift if we&rsquo;re willing to unpack it and look inside.
#meditation #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Is science underestimating consciousness? Can (human) consciousness become aware of its own emptyness (at the lowest level)?
#Spiritual seekers say yes. Science says we only have our 5 senses.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Life is asking us if we can live the lightness that we are at our core, or if we get confused by what we see and just live like everybody else.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Nothing in our environment holds us back. We just live blindly. #nofilter #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>There is nowhere to travel, nowhere to reach, these are ideas of the #ego.
There is only the return to ones self, the return to balance. Yin und Yang Here is where the power lies.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When we are ourselves we are our best.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Consciousness only makes sense where there is unconsciousness. These have a yin and yang relationship and couldnt exist without each other. Yin und Yang
Unconsciousness therefor is not the enemy, but just one part of the whole thing.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Alan Watts once famously said &ldquo;the godhead cannot see itself&rdquo;. Yes, true, but nevertheless: The godhead can <em>be</em> itself.
When you connect with your higher self in #meditation this becomes super important. The active god wouldnt need to look at himself in the mirror. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Doing anything one-sided is not sincere, while it may be useful.
True power lies with those who dare to go beyond usefulness.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The western society believes to have mastered intellectual thinking (the brain is our priority). This is not true. We have mastered making the brain go in very elaborate circles. This is not mastery, this is constipation. Our thoughts are not free. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Once the cyclic pattern of the brain has been lifted, only then youre able to think absolutely freely. But then you better have a good base to stand on. You need direction. Breaking cyclic patterns increases the awareness, required attention and energy for living. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>As a society we&rsquo;re way too excited about our brains. The brain is essentially just moving in circles. The personality just relates everything that happens back to our mostly unconscious persona. And especially discipline is one big cicle. Not that advanced, is it. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>In meditation, find the heavyness. Where is the uglyness, where is the burdon? Sit with it, become aware of it. This leads to more and more #stillness, as your whole system learns that it can take it. Say yes to everything. Stop running. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes, when we are in a place we have never been before and nobody is with us, it can seem like we are lost and off the right path. But most likely it just means that we have come a long long way and we&rsquo;re still growing. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The physical body is like a motor: The cleaner and purer the energy, the better and more effortlessly it runs. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>India has #yoga. China has #QiGong. Germany has McFit Lächelndes Gesicht mit geöffnetem Mund und lächelnden Augen (fitness studio chain). We travel lightly&hellip; #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Wenn wir hier auf Erden die Liebe vollständig in unseren Herzen spüren können, dann ist schon viel getan. #spirituality #german</p>
<hr>
<p>Dont ever estimate the current moment in the background of the previous moment. This diminishes growth. What has not been yesterday can be today. Not as the effect of a cause (#yang), but because we let it into our life (#yin). #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>I believe that all / most souls #incarnated on this earth to encounter the apparent absence of love. Many people experience this absence successfully, but in a way that says: &ldquo;oh no, i found it and it is REAL&rdquo;, i.e. taking the illusion too seriously. Thread #spirituality #thread

<hr>
<p>TV / Youtube teaches us subliminally to pay attention to only one, emotionally charged thing. Life has more dimensions than that. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>At their core, human beings just want to be seen for what they are. So when you decide to drop your assumptions and pay absolute attention, you eyes start glowing and they will pay you back with everything they have: what they are. #lostinthought #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Only when we stop making assumptions can we see the uglyness only when its really there, and the beauty in almost everything. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>If I cant find beauty in this moment, the next moment shall be in vain. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Every moment of our lifes we pick a base tone for our life. Look at this tone. Why did we pick this tone and not bliss? Look at it and you can make a new decision. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Holding on to thoughts creates a narrow mind. So dont hold onto your thoughts, but keep their intention. Intention always finds a way. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Within my heart burns the eternal flame (of life). #spirituality #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>The man setting an intention is the man sitting at an oasis sipping a drink, not the man running to battle wielding his weapon. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Intention is a / the godly tool. It defies all law. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Intention is the smallest current. It is not the forming of a fist or the tightening of facial muscles. It is the action in non action. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Skillful living is to have the system like itself. The truth is that the body itself doesnt like being sick or in disease. This only has to be aligned with our liking for the sweet pain of drama and our indecisiveness of wanting to love ourselves or not. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>If you become really good at being yourself, one could say you become fully self realized, a beautiful flowering of existance. If youre not, you&rsquo;re a little bit like everybody else, constantly anxious not to be. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Life is like a brochure. Only if you&rsquo;re interest you&rsquo;ll get more information. Or you can make some assumptions about it and throw it. #spirituality #mementomori</p>
<hr>
<p>Constantly working for tomorrow is a crime against your life. Because tomorrow never comes. #spirituality #mementomori</p>
<hr>
<p>Every moment can be used for enlightenment. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Why would you want to light up a dark room? Because you are only a temporary visitor. Just like a sightseeer you would want to see absolutely everything before moving on. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When sleeping is normal, death is surprising. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Life is wonderful. Sleeping may be boring. #meditativeThoughts #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be disappointed in the world, because the world can be enlightened by you. #meditativeThoughts #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Plants require a certain atmosphere to grow. This atmosphere is the same for humans. #spirituality #tantra</p>
<hr>
<p>The man who knows how to sit, breathe and walk knows about the secrets of the universe. #meditativethoughts #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Does your body hold your untouchable, or is it vice versa? When this relationship reverses, when the body no longer has to hold the spirit, it can relax, let go and heal, while now the spirit has the option to bring it to a higher possibility. #spirituality #meditativeThoughts</p>
<hr>
<p>The physical body holds something that is untouchable - in this lies the freedom.
#spirituality #meditativeThoughts</p>
<hr>
<p>What if besides all the illusions it would actually turn out that it mattered how we are within ourselves? Then only #spirituality would flourish - not personally, but socially and globally.</p>
<hr>
<p>Human connection holds a tremendous possibilty, while the intellect is a very sharp tool at best or a blunt one at its worst. Which one do you chose? #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>There is a tremendous possibility in exploring the #spirituality of the #unspiritual! Actually there is no such thing as being non-spiritual, it is just that &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; people keep an effort in keeping it low in themselves and others. This still requires a lot of knowledge!</p>
<hr>
<p>Intention is the smallest building block of creation and thereby also in a sense the only building block of creation and thereby existance. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Everything must align with a strong enough intention. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>I understand gurus now. They let people ask questions, thereby letting them exercise their intent of knowing. The very act of asking brings progress, as practice makes perfect and intent is the power of the universe. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Intent is the power of the universe. #spirituality #intent</p>
<hr>
<p>Intent is another word for life really #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Bitterness cannot happen to you if you have a tool to deal with the world. #spirituality #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Intent is that all-powerfull weapon / wisdom that can do it all. One does not need to move mountains, only keeping the intent is required. It&rsquo;s the golden rule of the universe and knows no exceptions. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Der Wald heilt dich nicht wirklich - er zeigt dir nur wie es geht. #nofilter #spirituality #mindfulness</p>
<hr>
<p>The greatest game can never be as good as the deepest trueth. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Breathing is our biggest mantra(?) #theorizing #mantra #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Turns out most thoughts we have are are actually for self-entertainment and not to reach a certain goal. Focusing on the third eye chakra naturally mutes those thoughts, which is huge. It feels like the personality changes. #spirituality #thirdeye</p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes you gotta take time to listen to your heart, because that shit is talking, and it would be kind of rude not to. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>People with long faces quite obviously live in an illusion. The illusion that something less than the heart is reality. And they feel stuck with it. But the heart never leaves. They always have the choice. #theorizing #hearttalk #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Meditation is SO important to keep a specific balance. Why? A specific quality of going outword (working, making decisions, etc.), cannot be maintained, without a specific quality of going inward. They need equal dedication. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Realization is temporary. As a consequence, some sort of higher state is also something we tend to move on from. Trusting in life, in that which comes next, is a very good idea. Forcing things in this realm is not healthy and also often does not work. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>People give comments about our egos, our personalities, so it may seem like these are what matters. This is just a temporary confusion though and will go away.. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous to believe that the mind is the only human governance. It is with heart and spirit that we shape our mind, so it can be a useful tool for us. The mind is not where our true identity is and it is not a strong place to establish connection. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Once you you find the strength to gain a victory over your own demons, for that moment you&rsquo;ll be able to connect with others deeply. This is because you are recognizing that which people are hiding from themselves. #spirituality #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>The ultimate defense is pure self-love. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>If you&rsquo;re open to a significant amount of variance, you&rsquo;ll find that you can describe nothing. In a situation of abundance, speech is of no use. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>At the best places you leave something that came from you and leave with something that is now yours #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Seek the greatest discomfort you and others can offer, and fully enjoy its presence. Stare into the eyes of the devil himself and be aware that without the greatest pain, joy had no meaning. #spirituality #theorizing #yingyang
Also a sure-fire way to return to the present moment.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not excited about each and every moment going forward in terms of the quality of your being, you&rsquo;re doing it wrong. This is a clear indicator that you&rsquo;re not in the moment, and thereby a first step to get back into it. Are you excited about the moment? #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Learning about #spirituality is usually a sweet pain. Learning about deep meditation makes it feel like a burdon having to keep the eyes open. Learning some more about love makes it disheartening to experience under which rare conditions people allow themselves to connect.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is no need to try and describe that which exceeds the intellect with words. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The forest is big. #spirituality</p>
