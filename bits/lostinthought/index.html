        <p><em>These &ldquo;bits&rdquo; I share here are short pieces of information that came up while being in</em>

<hr>
<p>Feel the energy of your heart, and then you will light your being.
#lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>At their core, human beings just want to be seen for what they are. So when you decide to drop your assumptions and pay absolute attention, you eyes start glowing and they will pay you back with everything they have: what they are. #lostinthought #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Within my heart burns the eternal flame (of life). #spirituality #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>What you defend and extend will ultimately imprison you. But it will work for survival. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Bitterness cannot happen to you if you have a tool to deal with the world. #spirituality #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>If life pulls you into one direction, don&rsquo;t pull into the opposite one. Then momentum could happen. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Accept life and you are life. And more than life you cannot be. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>When you give everybody what they want then you will be the leader. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Why would you be(!) different from your environment? Put yourself in a healthy environment (at times). #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>You can only guide people on a path that you have walked before. Otherwise you&rsquo;re just a leader. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Step aside and let your heart through. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>See yourself, see others. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Once you you find the strength to gain a victory over your own demons, for that moment you&rsquo;ll be able to connect with others deeply. This is because you are recognizing that which people are hiding from themselves. #spirituality #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>The fear of connection is the fear of disconnection. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>We are afraid of ourselfes, and that is what life is. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Hurt me, and you display your delusion. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>The beauty of life is that we have it in our hands. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>What inspires us is within is. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>I chose to not wonder about the things that are not a matter of wondering in the moment. This leaves me sometimes wondering, what I should be wondering about, since this could change every time. This uncertainty is exactly the price I pay to be in the moment. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Not what to do but how to be is a big big question, and everybody is answering it constantly. It&rsquo;s the question that cannot be dodged. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Show me how scary you are and lose the fight. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>When we don&rsquo;t look at ourselves, we see everything. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Only if you actually believe that you can do all of these items on your daily list, will you give each individual item the care it deserves with the joy that is worth living. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Being surrounded by very capable people, who could very well bring you down if they wanted to, can seem threatening. However this really is the kind of situation we need to be longing for, because we would be blessed if everybody reached his full potential. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get confused by your own looks, as they don&rsquo;t define you, unless you get confused by your own looks. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>With a substantial amount of ignorance and a substantial amount of arrogance you could dominate anybody. Even kill a person without regret. That&rsquo;s in part why people are not spiritual. It would mean taking down the weapons #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Love is life (in possibly every imaginable way. work, relationships, values etc.) #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>What do we know about who we want to be? #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>The rules of causality, or in other words, the fact that one action (the &ldquo;reaction&rdquo;) must be in a relationship to a previous action, are rules the heart does not (have to) follow.
Listening to / being with the heart is thereby hugely relaxing. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Explaining something, makes something less beautiful and also risks missing the point entirely #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>In any case, we look at the beauty within #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>We need to stop rewarding looks, emotional and mental juggles, because it is beings that connect and thereby we need to reward great beings #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>No need to judge, no need to look, when the gut already know what&rsquo;s good. #lostinthought #rhiming</p>
<hr>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get used to the emotions you feel and the energies you wield&hellip; because they need to transform. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>From our first moment to our last moment we are free to _________ (fill in the blank). #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Attachment is salvation for the mono-focused / focus-limited. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>The way we usually use our focus is not very spiritual #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Different forms of life are always available. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Your flying altitude is the depth you risk falling into. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>If you&rsquo;re running around with a guitar and let everbody you meet play a note, there&rsquo;s never going to come a nice song out of that. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Once you lose a map, the notes you made about the shortcuts lose their meaning #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>There is no alternative to just being oneself. There is a place where the heart knows this so clearly, that the mind is not able to create any illusions about it. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Truely giving up on happyness and easing into whatever is there on all levels turns suffering into pain and being into joy. #lostinthought #enlightenment</p>
<hr>
<p>As long as you feel bad there is always this urge to solve problems, to get busy and to chase this and that goal with no end in sight. As soon as you feel good, well, there isn&rsquo;t. #meditation #calmingdown #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Meeting a passionate woman is always a dance, a playful back and forth, and never an act, or even a piece of work. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Once you face something, not in anger but in awe, something new can happen. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to speak in a non-learning environment. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Start listening to your state of being and you can stop watching the movie of your projection #meditation #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Being emotionally and physically unrelaxed / tense is usefull to override and control ones own undesired natural reactions. Being uncomfortable is not an accident, it is a tool we chose to use. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>The key to start maintaining relaxation is to get relaxed about moments of stress. This enables you to start the relaxation process again, while getting better and better at observing your own stress. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Emotional and physical comfort is where mental stability is easily maintained. This way comfort is nothing to look down upon #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>The more of yourself you are able to recognize in the other, the stronger the connection. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Pain becomes just another state of being once I decide to make peace with it. Pain is not suffering, only I can create that. #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you can never seperate yourself from the problem you are perceiving, not even through the greatest judgement.(2/2) #lostinthought

<p>We find discomfort in comfort one or the other way #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Consciousness is hard to find unconsciously #lostinthought</p>
