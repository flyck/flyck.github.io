<p>Life is a gift if we&rsquo;re willing to unpack it and look inside.
#meditation #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Is science underestimating consciousness? Can (human) consciousness become aware of its own emptyness (at the lowest level)?
#Spiritual seekers say yes. Science says we only have our 5 senses.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Life is asking us if we can live the lightness that we are at our core, or if we get confused by what we see and just live like everybody else.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>There is nowhere to travel, nowhere to reach, these are ideas of the #ego.
There is only the return to ones self, the return to balance. Yin und Yang Here is where the power lies.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When we are ourselves we are our best.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Consciousness only makes sense where there is unconsciousness. These have a yin and yang relationship and couldnt exist without each other. Yin und Yang
Unconsciousness therefor is not the enemy, but just one part of the whole thing.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Doing anything one-sided is not sincere, while it may be useful.
True power lies with those who dare to go beyond usefulness.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The western society believes to have mastered intellectual thinking (the brain is our priority). This is not true. We have mastered making the brain go in very elaborate circles. This is not mastery, this is constipation. Our thoughts are not free. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>#Meditation is like building a castle out of a slightly shittier version of that same castle on that same spot. And it all starts with wondering if you should pick up that shovel. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Only when we forget about work completely during the weekend, can we start fresh on monday. #theorizing #meditation</p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes, when we are in a place we have never been before and nobody is with us, it can seem like we are lost and off the right path. But most likely it just means that we have come a long long way and we&rsquo;re still growing. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The physical body is like a motor: The cleaner and purer the energy, the better and more effortlessly it runs. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>India has #yoga. China has #QiGong. Germany has McFit Lächelndes Gesicht mit geöffnetem Mund und lächelnden Augen (fitness studio chain). We travel lightly&hellip; #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Only when we stop making assumptions can we see the uglyness only when its really there, and the beauty in almost everything. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Every moment of our lifes we pick a base tone for our life. Look at this tone. Why did we pick this tone and not bliss? Look at it and you can make a new decision. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Holding on to thoughts creates a narrow mind. So dont hold onto your thoughts, but keep their intention. Intention always finds a way. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Conscious thought starts with an intention set by the heart. The rest is thought triggered by thought - like a perpeto-o-mobile, or thought triggered by sensations in the body. Triggered thought is not conscious thought. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The man setting an intention is the man sitting at an oasis sipping a drink, not the man running to battle wielding his weapon. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Intention is a / the godly tool. It defies all law. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Conscious thought starts with an intention set by the heart. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Intention is the smallest current. It is not the forming of a fist or the tightening of facial muscles. It is the action in non action. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>If you become really good at being yourself, one could say you become fully self realized, a beautiful flowering of existance. If youre not, you&rsquo;re a little bit like everybody else, constantly anxious not to be. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Why would you want to light up a dark room? Because you are only a temporary visitor. Just like a sightseeer you would want to see absolutely everything before moving on. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When sleeping is normal, death is surprising. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>If there was no such thing as exhaustion (mental, physical or otherwise), people would simply slave away in the factories, completely disregarding other aspects of life. With exhaustion balance and well-being becomes a major issue. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The greatest game can never be as good as the deepest trueth. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Breathing is our biggest mantra(?) #theorizing #mantra #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Spending time being active with the body is health. While it can seem unproductive besides all the goal achieving, doing #Yoga or #TaiChi is thereby of vital importance. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Why do we give a smile to people who are in a lot of pain? Because we can imagine how it is to be them. For people for which we cannot imagine this we dont give a smile. The ability to see yourself in others creates connection. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The ego is mostly unaware of the mechanisms which run behind its self-inflicted misery. But that&rsquo;s also not its job. Its job is to provide mental sanity and emotional guidance through the mind, in a place where without the heart there&rsquo;s hardly anything to hold on to. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>People with long faces quite obviously live in an illusion. The illusion that something less than the heart is reality. And they feel stuck with it. But the heart never leaves. They always have the choice. #theorizing #hearttalk #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Meditation is SO important to keep a specific balance. Why? A specific quality of going outword (working, making decisions, etc.), cannot be maintained, without a specific quality of going inward. They need equal dedication. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Realization is temporary. As a consequence, some sort of higher state is also something we tend to move on from. Trusting in life, in that which comes next, is a very good idea. Forcing things in this realm is not healthy and also often does not work. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>People give comments about our egos, our personalities, so it may seem like these are what matters. This is just a temporary confusion though and will go away.. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>You could become old and wise, without touching anybody with this wisdom, and then you die. In this context, how high does wisdom need to be on ones life agenda? #spirtuality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous to believe that the mind is the only human governance. It is with heart and spirit that we shape our mind, so it can be a useful tool for us. The mind is not where our true identity is and it is not a strong place to establish connection. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Writing is holding on to what the mind does, because that shit is incredible. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Seek the greatest discomfort you and others can offer, and fully enjoy its presence. Stare into the eyes of the devil himself and be aware that without the greatest pain, joy had no meaning. #spirituality #theorizing #yingyang
Also a sure-fire way to return to the present moment.</p>
<hr>
<p>Clarity can be strength. If planning ahead and making decisions feels like the constant blarring of a poorly tuned radio, here is how you escape: Connect to the part of you that really just wants to live no matter what. This is a place of clarity, strength and joy. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>There is no need to try and describe that which exceeds the intellect with words. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>If you see fear, look her directly into the eyes. She likes that ;) #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>How do you know that you&rsquo;re alive? If you can answer this question with a pleasant feeling inside, you&rsquo;ve made it. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Clarity is not pleasantness. It is not making a story out of something that is not a story, which can be pleasant. #theorizing</p>
